# Automated-LVM-using-Python-scripts

We integrated LVM with Python in order to provide the Elasticity property to the data node in HDFS Cluster.

You can find the code in lvm2.py file

Video file I attached shows how the implementation looks like!!

Note: I used Redhat Enterprise Linux (RHEL8) which is hosted on Oracle Virtualbox.

For any doubts, kindly reach me through
